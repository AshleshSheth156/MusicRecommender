# Music Recommender System

This repository contains a Music Recommender System implemented using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm along with a Tableau workbook for visualizing music data.

# Tableau Workbook

The Tableau workbook included in this project provides interactive visualizations for analyzing music data. It offers insights into song popularity, artist trends, user listening behavior, and more. Users can explore the data through various dashboards and charts.

# How to Use Tableau Workbook
  `Requirements: Ensure Tableau software is installed.`
  Opening the Workbook: Open the Tableau workbook file (filename.twb) using Tableau software.
  Interact with Visualizations: Explore different sheets and dashboards to analyze music data dynamically.

# Music Recommender System (Python Notebook)

The Python notebook (music_recommender.ipynb) implements a Music Recommender System using the KNN method. It utilizes a dataset of song preferences to recommend similar songs based on user input.

# How to Use Music Recommender System
  Requirements: Install Jupyter Notebook and required Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn).
  Run the Notebook: Open and run the Python notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
  Input: Follow the instructions within the notebook to input user preferences and get recommended songs.

# Dataset
The project utilizes a music dataset containing song details, user preferences, and other relevant information. 

# Contributions

Contributions to enhance the music recommender system or improve visualizations in the Tableau workbook are welcome. Feel free to fork this repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.
